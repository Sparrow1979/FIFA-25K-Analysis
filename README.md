Project name: Betting on Football

Description: The goal of this project is to extract the potential business insights from the “Ultimate 25k+ Matches Football Database” for my company, while we aim to offer a new betting field - soccer. The overall idea is to get the following insights:

Which leagues are in which countries?
Which leagues score the most/fewest goals?
Who are the top scorers in each team and league?
Is there such a thing as home advantage?
Can we predict how many goals each team will score in each match?
Can we predict which team will win the match?

The main objective is to figure out if the database can help the company predict the outcome of the future matches accurately enough to adjust the accurate betting odds and thus, earn from the betting activity good margins. In addition, which league should the company focus first to guarantee the interest from sport betters.
In addition to business goal, this project aims to:

Practice identifying opportunities for data analysis, raising hypothesis, and formulating research tasks.
Practice performing EDA, statistical inference, and prediction.
Practice working with SQL datasets.
Practice visualizing data.
